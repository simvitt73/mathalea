(CAN).<br>
  Il est plus souvent composé de 30 questions (parfois 20 pour les CE1/CE2) réparties de la façon suivante. 
  Les 10 premières questions, parfois communes à plusieurs niveaux, font appel à des questions élémentaires et les 20 suivantes (qui ne sont pas rangées dans un ordre de difficulté) sont un peu plus « coûteuses » cognitivement.<br>
  Par défaut, les questions sont rangées dans le même ordre que le sujet officiel avec des données aléatoires. Ainsi, en cliquant sur « Nouvelles données », on obtient une nouvelle Course Aux Nombres avec des données différentes.<br>
  Dans les CAN depuis 2024, le choix des questions permet de choisir certaines questions parmi les 30. <br>
  Dans les CAN d'avant 2024, on pouvait seulement choisir le nombre de questions comme décrit ci-après. <br>
  En choisissant un nombre de questions inférieur à 30, on fabrique une « mini » Course Aux Nombres qui respecte la proportion de nombre de questions élémentaires par rapport aux autres.
  Par exemple, en choisissant 20 questions, la course aux nombres sera composée de 7 ou 8 questions élémentaires choisies aléatoirement dans les 10 premières questions du sujet officiel puis de 12 ou 13 autres questions choisies aléatoirement parmi les 20 autres questions du sujet officiel.`}}const il=[...Array(199).keys()].map(t=>(t+1900).toString()),Rm=["janvier","février","mars","avril","mai","juin","juillet","août","septembre","octobre","novembre","décembre"];function Fr(t){if(t===void 0)return!1;const[e,n,i]=t.split("/"),s=new Date(parseInt(i),parseInt(n)-1,parseInt(e)),a=Date.now()-s.getTime(),c=3600*24*30*1e3;return a<c}function ds(t){const e=new Map;for(const n of Object.keys(t))t[n]instanceof Object?t[n]instanceof Array?e.set(n,t[n]):e.set(n,ds(t[n])):e.set(n,t[n]);return e}function Im(t){return ol(t,e=>xn(e)?!!(e.datePublication&&Fr(e.datePublication)||e.dateModification&&Fr(e.dateModification)):!1)}function vi(t){return ol(t,()=>!0)}function Qa(t){const e=jr,n=Bu;return e[t]?e[t]:n[t]?n[t]:t}function sl(t,e,n){Object.values(t).forEach(i=>{qr(i)?n(i)&&e.push(i):sl(i,e,n)})}function ol(t,e){const n=[],i=[];function s(a){Object.entries(a).forEach(([c,l])=>{qr(l)?e(l)&&(i.push(c),n.push({resource:l,pathToResource:[...i]}),i.pop()):(i.push(c),s(l),i.pop())})}return s(t),n}function al(t,e){const n=[];switch(sl(t,n,i=>i.uuid===e),n.length){case 0:return null;case 1:return n[0];default:return n[0]}}function ym(t){return t.pathToResource.reduceRight((e,n)=>({[n]:e}),t.resource)}function Om(t){const e=[];for(const n of t)e.push(ym(n));return e}function Zi(t){return Om(t).reduce((e,n)=>cl(e,n),{})}function cl(...t){const e=n=>n&&typeof n=="object";return t.reduce((n,i)=>(Object.keys(i).forEach(s=>{const a=n[s],c=i[s];Array.isArray(a)&&Array.isArray(c)?n[s]=a.concat(...c):e(a)&&e(c)?n[s]=cl(a,c):n[s]=c}),n),{})}const Oi={...ks,...Ts};delete Oi.BrevetTags;delete Oi.EVACOMTags;delete Oi.E3CTags;delete Oi.crpeTags;const ll=(t=[])=>{const e=[],n=Se(Ne),i=Se(Me);for(const s of i)if(!(t.length>0&&!t.includes(s.uuid)))if(Ko(s.uuid)){const a=new Promise(c=>{const l=new Gr;l.titre=`Uuid ${s.uuid}`,l.listeQuestions[0]=`Uuid ${s.uuid}<br>`,l.listeCorrections[0]=`Uuid ${s.uuid}<br>`,l.nbQuestions=1;const u=al(Oi,s.uuid);Yr(u)&&(l.listeQuestions[0]=l.listeQuestions[0]+`<br>
