# Note: In order to avoid entering your password every time you deploy, you can set up SSH keys for passwordless authentication.
# You can do this by running the following command and following the instructions:
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
# This will prompt you to enter a file in which to save the key (you can press Enter to accept the default location).
# You can also set a passphrase for additional security, but if you want to avoid entering any password, leave it empty.
#
# Use the following command to copy your public key to the remote server:
# ssh-copy-id REMOTE_SERVER
# Make sure to replace REMOTE_SERVER with your actual remote server address.
# This command will prompt you for your password one last time to copy the key.
